# CPASS REPORT TEMPLATES
Report templates for CPass, to be used via BIRT.

## Development
Each report MUST also be complemented by the defining SQL definitions, to be added in the `cpassdb` project.

### TODO
- [ ] SQL syntax to use

## Configuration
In case a new profile is to be added, it MUST be referenced in the `<profiles>` section of the `pom.xml`. As of now, no particular specialization is given for any single profile, but they are defined by symmetry with other projects.
